# ArcEasy || ArcEasyObjects #

ArcEasy is an ORM (Object Relation Mapping) proposal to make easy the life of an ArcObjects Developer.

Once you need to add a new Developer to your GIS Team, you need to find out an ESRI Developer, so you discover that is more easy to found a Microsft Developer than an ArcObjects Developer.

###  Disclaimer ###

Don't think that you don't need your Developer know ArcObjects
